This is a README file for my final submission. Please make sure that when you first open the project you open this file. 

This project is Structured as follows: 

1. The Menu.java class is the main class which runs the entire application. 
2. It will reference methods within the Train_Station class which it inherits. 
3. The Train_Station class focuses on defining the Train Station object and populating its fields, along with searching, creating, modifying and removing stations
4. The Train_Station.choice() method will pull up the user interface and provide all the features required in this project. 
5. The class Route is inherited from Train_Station and is focused on the creation of routes and directions for the user.


Have fun testing/grading my semester-long project! It sure was fun to build. :D
